# Building w/ Tkinter using MVC pattern

Following [tutorial](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-mvc/), I'll be building an email validator 

Current understanding:
- Model - data is managed here i.e. validation, storage/retrieval from databases
- View - UI in which data from Model is shown
- Controller - Links the Model w/ View
